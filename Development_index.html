        <p>First generation: The instructions were entered through the keyboards of the computer system, and this language was actually zero and one (0,1).</p>
        <p>Second generation: The digital symbol in the machine language is replaced by a set of acronyms in English, which is a giant leap in the world of programming languages.</p>
		<P>Third generation: Named procedural languages and higher than assembly languages.The problems in the assembly languages depended on the type of therapist the programmers had to think and deal with every detail of the program.</P>
	    <P>Fourth generation: The third round of software languages is the product of software language development. Except for languages in certain fields, the fourth generation of languages emerged away from the machine language and went into normal languages (databases, report generators, data analysis, destination, mathematical improvement language). This generation can create programs without writing only code, analyzing and creating programs via an official interface.</P>
	    <P>Fifth generation: It's a language that allows computers to run software without a programmer and without knowing how to write the code.</P>
