        <p>Highlevel programming languages are more complex than the languages which the computer actually understands, called machine languages, but they are simple compared to human languages. Each specific type of CPU has its own unique language for machines.Lying between machine languages and languages of the highest level are languages which are called assembly languages.</p><br />
        <p>Assembly languages are similar to machine languages but are much simpler to program in because they require a programmer to substitute numbers with names. Machine languages are composed only of numbers.Lying above are languages of the fourth-generation (usually abbreviated 4GL) languages.4GLs are far removed from machine languages and represent the class of computer languages closest to human languages.</p><br />
